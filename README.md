# nextjs-zustand

NestJS application using zustand

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn # To install dependencies
yarn dev # To launch the app
```

## To get further

I advice you to check [this work](https://codesandbox.io/s/ku82o) from clb who implemented a similar logic as `next-redux-wrapper` for state hydration
